üìé This project does not include business insights. It is intended for practice only.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The code, analysis, and outputs in this project are not to be copied and used elsewhere, including in resumes or other projects that's why i attached jupyter notebook pdf only.The goal of this project is to practice and improve my skills, not to provide ready-to-use solutions.

-->Feel free to refer to the attached Jupyter notebook PDF for practice and understanding the concepts. This project is meant to showcase my personal learning journey through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and you can use it as a reference to practice and enhance your skills in data analysis.

-‚≠ê This EDA project was completed as part of my data analytics training/Journey And the EDA Project Done At <a href="https://futurevisioncomputers.com/">Future Vision Computer Institute</a>,Surat.
